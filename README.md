# Terminal-LED-Strip-Simulator
Simulate an LED strip via spaces in a terminal to ease Arduino programming and make it independant of hardware.

# Usage
This simple project was created to ease the development code for LED strips. The simulator works in a terminal because it is fun.
Before using the simulator you should check if your terminal support full RBG color codes i.e. 0-255 for red, blue, and green.
If not you can install a different one. The linux preinstalled GNU terminal normally supports the color range and the 
terminal manager "terminator" also supports it. 
So far everything is still in a very rough shape. I still need to write libraries and everything so that the implementation
can be used in a simpler manner, but as this project was meant to be fun and to be played around with, I hope you enjoy.

The code is very short so I guess it should be simple to figure it out.
